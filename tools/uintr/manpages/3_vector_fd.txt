uintr_vector_fd(2)            System Calls Manual           uintr_vector_fd(2)



NAME
       uintr_vector_fd - Create a user interrupt file descriptor - uvec_fd


SYNOPSIS
        int uintr_vector_fd(u64 vector, unsigned int flags);


DESCRIPTION
       uintr_vector_fd()  allocates  a  new  user  interrupt  file  descriptor
       (uvec_fd) based on the vector registered by the  calling  process.  The
       uvec_fd can be shared with other processes and the kernel to allow them
       to generate interrupts with the associated vector.

       The caller must have registered a handler via uintr_register_handler(2)
       before  attempting to create uvec_fd. The interrupts generated based on
       this uvec_fd will be delivered only to the  thread  that  created  this
       file  descriptor.  A  unique  uvec_fd  is  generated  for  each  vector
       registered using uintr_vector_fd().

       Each thread has a private vector space of 64 vectors ranging from 0-63.
       Vector number 63 has the highest priority while vector number 0 has the
       lowest.  If two or more interrupts are pending to be delivered then the
       interrupt  with  the  higher  vector  number  will  be  delivered first
       followed by the ones with lower vector numbers. Applications can choose
       appropriate  vector  numbers  to  prioritize  certain  interrupts  over
       others.

       Upon interrupt delivery, the handler is invoked with the vector  number
       pushed  onto  the  stack  to help identify the source of the interrupt.
       Since the vector space is per-thread, each receiver can receive  up  to
       64 unique interrupt events.

       A  receiver can choose to share the same uvec_fd with multiple senders.
       Since an interrupt with the same vector number would be delivered,  the
       receiver  would  need  to  use  other  mechanisms to identify the exact
       source of the interrupt.

       The flags argument is reserved for future use.  Currently, it  must  be
       specified as 0.

       close(2)
             When the file descriptor is no longer required it should be
             closed.  When all file descriptors associated with the same
             uvec_fd object have been closed, the resources for object are
             freed by the kernel.

       fork(2)
             A copy of the file descriptor created by uintr_vector_fd() is
             inherited by the child produced by fork(2).  The duplicate file
             descriptor is associated with the same uvec_fd object. The
             close-on-exec flag (FD_CLOEXEC; see fcntl(2)) is set on the
             file descriptor returned by uintr_vector_fd().

       For  information  on  how  to  generate  interrupts  with uvec_fd refer
       uintr_register_sender(2).


RETURN VALUE
       On success, uintr_vector_fd() returns a new  uvec_fd  file  descriptor.
       On  error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the cause of the
       error.


ERRORS
       ENOSYS  Underlying hardware doesn't have support for Uintr(7).

       EINVAL      flags is not 0.

       EFAULT      handler address is not valid.

       EMFILE        The  per-process  limit  on  the  number  of  open   file
       descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE        The  system-wide  limit on the total number of open files
       has been reached.

       ENODEV       Could not mount (internal) anonymous inode device.

       ENOMEM      The system is out of available memory to allocate uvec_fd.

       ENOSPC      The requested vector is out of available range.


VERSIONS
       uintr_vector_fd() first appeared in Linux <tbd>.


CONFORMING TO
       uintr_vector_fd() is Linux specific.


NOTES
       Currently, there is no glibc wrapper for  this  system  call;  call  it
       using syscall(2).

       The  user  interrupt  related  system  calls  need  hardware support to
       generate and receive user interrupts. Refer uintr(7) for details.
