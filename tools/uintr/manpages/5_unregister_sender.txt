uintr_unregister_sender(2)    System Calls Manual   uintr_unregister_sender(2)



NAME
       uintr_unregister_sender  -  Unregister  a  user inter-process interrupt
       sender


SYNOPSIS
        int uintr_unregister_sender(int ipi_index, unsigned int flags);


DESCRIPTION
       uintr_unregister_sender() unregisters  a  sender  process  based  on  a
       ipi_index  it had previously received. If no entry is present with this
       ipi_index the system call return an error.

       The uipi_index that was allocated during uintr_register_sender(2)  will
       be  freed.  If  a  process  tries to use a uipi_index after it has been
       freed it would receive a SIGSEGV signal.

       In case of  a  multi-threaded  process  uintr_unregister_sender()  will
       remove  this connection from all the threads that share the same Target
       table.

       The flags argument is reserved for future use.  Currently, it  must  be
       specified as 0.


RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  uintr_unregister_sender()  returns  0.  On  error,  -1 is
       returned and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.


ERRORS
       ENOSYS  Underlying hardware doesn't have support for uintr(7).

       EINVAL      flags is not 0.

       EINVAL      No connection has been setup for this ipi_index.


VERSIONS
       uintr_unregister_sender() first appeared in Linux <tbd>.


CONFORMING TO
       uintr_unregister_sender() is Linux specific.


NOTES
       Currently, there is no glibc wrapper for  this  system  call;  call  it
       using syscall(2).

       The  user  interrupt  related  system  calls  need  hardware support to
       generate and receive user interrupts. Refer uintr(7) for details.
