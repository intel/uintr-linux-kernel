uintr_wait(2)                 System Calls Manual                uintr_wait(2)



NAME
       uintr_wait - wait for user interrupts


SYNOPSIS
        int uintr_wait(u64 usec, unsigned int flags);


DESCRIPTION
       uintr_wait() causes the calling process (or thread) to suspend for usec
       microseconds until a user interrupt is  delivered.  The  sleep  may  be
       lengthened  slightly  by  any  system  activity  or  by  the time spent
       processing the call or by the granularity of system timers.

       uintr_wait() will block in the kernel only when a interrupt handler has
       been registered using uintr_register_handler(2)

       <uintr_wait()  is an experimental syscall to allow applications to wait
       specifically for uintr(7).>


RETURN VALUE
       uintr_wait() returns 0 upon successfully suspending  execution  for  at
       least  usec microseconds. In case of error, -1 is returned and errno is
       set to indicate the error.

       If it is interrupted by a uintr(7), EINTR is set as the error code.


ERRORS
       ENOSYS  Underlying hardware doesn't have support for Uintr.

       EOPNOTSUPP  No interrupt handler registered.

       EINVAL        flags is not 0.

       EINVAL        usec is greater than 1000000000 (1000 seconds).

       EINTR       A user interrupt was received  and  the  interrupt  handler
       returned.


VERSIONS
       uintr_wait() first appeared in Linux <tbd>.


CONFORMING TO
       uintr_wait() is Linux specific.


NOTES
       Currently,  there  is  no  glibc  wrapper for this system call; call it
       using syscall(2).

       The user interrupt  related  system  calls  need  hardware  support  to
       generate and receive user interrupts. Refer uintr(7) for details.
