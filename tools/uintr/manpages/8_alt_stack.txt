uintr_alt_stack(2)            System Calls Manual           uintr_alt_stack(2)



NAME
       uintr_alt_stack - wait for user interrupts


SYNOPSIS
        int uintr_alt_stack(void  *sp, size_t size, unsigned int flags);


DESCRIPTION
       uintr_alt_stack()  allows  a  thread  to  define  an alternate stack to
       handle a User Interrupt.

       sp      Base address of the stack

       size      Number of bytes in the stack

       flags      Flags to modify behavior

       The current expectation is for a thread to register an alternate  stack
       only after it has registered a User Interrupt handler.

       Calling  uintr_alt_stack()  with  a  NULL  base address would clear the
       alternate stack request.

       uintr_unregister_handler(2)  would  also  clear  any  alternate   stack
       request that have been made.


RETURN VALUE
       On  success, uintr_alt_stack() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned and
       errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.


ERRORS
       ENOSYS  Underlying hardware doesn't have support for Uintr.

       EOPNOTSUPP  No interrupt handler registered.

       EINVAL        flags is not 0.


VERSIONS
       uintr_alt_stack() first appeared in Linux <tbd>.


CONFORMING TO
       uintr_alt_stack() is Linux specific.


NOTES
       Currently, there is no glibc wrapper for  this  system  call;  call  it
       using syscall(2).

       The  user  interrupt  related  system  calls  need  hardware support to
       generate and receive user interrupts. Refer uintr(7) for details.
